Following guides to learn the basics of building a Remote Access Tool with C.

This respository will contain code that can function as a reverse shell & keylogger.

This is for educational purposes and is in no way intended to break any laws or be used maliciously by ANYONE.

This source code does not provide any unique functionality or exploit that isn't 
already present in many open source repositories and ethical pen testing tools.

# Goals (Initial course)
- [x] Main function that establishes a connection with a server 
- [x] Shell function that waits for commands and iterates over options
- [x] ~~automatically start client program on reboot~~
- [x] ~~spawn other programs on client machine~~
- [x] ability to remotely navigate through client directories
- [x] ~~implement keylogger in client program~~

# NEW Goals
- [ ] re-write keylogger myself
- [ ] Allow remote script execution
- [ ] Reduce keylogger detectability
- [ ] Handle multiple client connections simultaneously
- [x] bypass anti-virus
